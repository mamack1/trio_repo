Flip Flop:

Flip Flop is a 2D platformer that utilizes gravity manipulation to acquire collectibles, necessary items, and avoid hazards. Aside from gravity, our level design is a big factor in our game. It is designed to be difficult and requires excellent timing to complete levels.

Flip Flop is simple in its design. The gravity manipulation mechanic provided an excellent opportunity to utilize contrasting colors. We went with a classic black and white 8-bit style to ensure it was visually appealing.

Modular Design:

We developed a great foundation for our game. We have started with one level and focused on providing a base for future-level design. There are many more levels, mechanics, hazards, traps, enemies, secrets, and improvements to come!

Thank You,

Team Gamechanger
